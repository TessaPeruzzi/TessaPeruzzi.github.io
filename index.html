<h2>What is this Website For?</h2>

<div class="info">
<p>Before college, I spent 5 years learning French. While I initially took the class with the mindset of just fulfilling the highschool
language requirement, I soon came to realize learning languages would be a passion of mine. Never before would I have imaganined that
I could become so proficient in a language that I started thinking in that language as soon as I entered class! 
</p>

<p>Entering college, I was faced with a tough decision, further my French knowledge or learn a new language? I knew I had already gone
    far with French and wanted to begin my next language venture, so I decided to take Japanese in college. However, I knew without the practice
I was used to, I would slowly forget more and more of my French knowledge. Thinking about what I could do to prevent this, I realized combining
all that I had learned into one pace would be a great idea! With this, I decided to self-teach on HTML and CSS so I could combine
all that I had learned into a website. As I further my coding skills, I can make the website more visually appealing, as well as add games
that will help me practice! </p>
